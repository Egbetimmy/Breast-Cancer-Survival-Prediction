Breast Cancer Survival Prediction with Clinical and Gene Expression Data

### Overview

Cancer is a disease in which cells in the human body grow uncontrollably. This phenomenon often spreads to other parts of the body. Human bodies contain
trillions of cells. Human growth starts with a one-celled zygote. Both sperm and egg from parents meet and form the zygote. The process of cell division is essential to human life to form various tissues and organs as the body needs
them. The cells also have a life cycle. As they grow older or are damaged, the cells die and are replaced with new ones. This natural process sometimes breaks
and abnormal or damaged cells keep multiplying. These unwanted cells may form tumors. Such a situation is known as cancer.

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer after skin cancer in women. It affects nearly 2.1 million women every year globally. Genetic information is the
software that runs behind every biological organism. Modern genetic measurement technologies such as Next Generation Sequencing and Microarray
show light on active and inactive genes responsible for certain biological functions. Comparing these gene expression changes for healthy and cancerous
cells sheds light on the causal factors associated with cancer growth. This gives better insights into cancer prognosis and treatment plans such as therapy.
Machine learning helps us to learn complex patterns from intricate data that are difficult for human beings to recognize manually. One such use case is
estimating the survival time and hence preventing unnecessary surgical treatments. Here in this project, the survival status is predicted using gene
expression data and clinical data using classical machine learning algorithms.
